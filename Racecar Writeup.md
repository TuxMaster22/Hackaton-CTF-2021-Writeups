Ssh kick us out.

SCP did not work either

Why not sftp.

found out those files 

found out rc file

I downloaded with 

get rc kali@kali:~



pkill and then a logout, that’s  insane

I added sleep 6000 to the rc file.


save it and then went back to the SFTP session.




I uploaded the new rc file inside the old rc file.



finally!

what about checking privileges


Awesome, as you may see just using sudo and find I found the flag.

thanks!
